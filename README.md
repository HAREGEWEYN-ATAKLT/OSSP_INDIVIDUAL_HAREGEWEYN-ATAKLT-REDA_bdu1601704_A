## INSTALLATION

This project explains how to install Syllable OS using VirtualBox. First, a new virtual machine is created and configured with suitable RAM and disk size. The Syllable OS ISO file is then mounted to boot the system. Installation is guided through a graphical interface with simple steps. After setup, the system is ready for basic tasks and testing.

## SYSTEM CALL IMPLEMENTATION

The recv() system call is used to receive data from a connected socket. It reads incoming data sent by a client over a network connection. This function is useful in building network-based programs like chat apps or data receivers. In Syllable OS, recv() works with basic socket features. It helps the server handle incoming communication from clients.
